Open Source with SLU is a champion and resource for all things "open" at Saint Louis University. Open science, open scholarship, open data, and open source software are closely interrelated concepts that collectively aim to promote transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in research, education, and knowledge dissemination. While each concept has its unique focus, they share common goals and principles, and their implementation reinforces one another.

## Open Source Software

Open source software enables collaborative research and sustainable innovation.

Open source software is a set of principles and practices. The most obvious practice is making the human-readable "source" code for software freely available for use, study, modification, and distribution. This fosters transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Open source principles promote transparency by making code openly accessible, aligning with reproducibility goals in research. Open source solutions provide cost-effective, customizable alternatives to proprietary software, promoting vendor independence and long-term sustainability. The collaborative nature of open source communities drives sustained innovation and robust software development through diverse contributions and knowledge sharing.

Research software, a specific category of open source software, plays a crucial role in enabling open science and open scholarship practices. Research software benefits from open source practices, enabling reproducible research workflows, data analysis tools, and collaborative platforms. The adoption of open source research software facilitates open access, open data, and open educational resource initiatives, fostering an ecosystem of shared knowledge and collaboration across disciplines. By embracing open source software, researchers and scholars can drive innovation, enhance software quality, and contribute to a culture of openness in academia.

## Open Science

Open Science promotes transparency and reproducibility in research.

Open science is a movement that advocates for transparency, collaboration, and accessibility in scientific research. By embracing open practices such as open data, open access publishing, open source software, open peer review, and open collaboration, researchers can enhance the quality, reproducibility, and impact of their work. Open science principles and practices are fundamental to enabling Open Scholarship and Open Data.

## Open Scholarship

Open Scholarship fosters openness across academic activities.

Open scholarship extends the principles of openness beyond scientific research to encompass all scholarly activities, including teaching, learning, and public engagement. It embraces open access publishing, open educational resources, open collaboration, open peer review, and open advocacy. Open scholarship promotes the free exchange of knowledge, fosters equity and inclusivity, and enhances the societal impact of academic work.

## Open Data

Open data enables data-driven discoveries and sustainable innovation.

Open data refers to the practice of making data freely available for everyone to access, reuse, and redistribute. By embracing open data principles such as accessibility, reusability, interoperability, and transparency, researchers, organizations, and governments can unlock the potential of data-driven discoveries, foster collaboration, and drive innovation across various sectors.

## An Interconnected Landscape

These four concepts are interconnected and mutually reinforcing:
* **Open Science enables Open Data and Open Source Software:** Open science practices, such as preregistration, reproducible research, and open notebooks, promote the sharing and reuse of research data and software, aligning with open data and open source principles.
* **Open Data and Open Source Software fuel Open Science:** The availability of open data and open source software facilitates new scientific discoveries, enables validation of research findings, and supports the principles of open science, such as transparency and reproducibility.
* **Open Scholarship integrates Open Science, Open Data, and Open Source Software:** Open scholarship embraces open science principles and practices, while also promoting open data sharing, open source software utilization, and their integration across diverse scholarly activities, including teaching, learning, and public engagement.
* **Open Scholarship fosters Open Science, Open Data, and Open Source Software:** By advocating for openness in academia, open scholarship encourages the adoption of open science, open data, and open source software practices, fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration.
* **Open Source Software enables Open Science and Open Scholarship:** The use of open source software tools and platforms facilitates open science practices, such as reproducible research and open collaboration, while also supporting open scholarship activities like open publishing and open educational practices.
* **Open Data and Open Science drive Open Source Software development:** The availability of open data and the need for open, transparent, and reproducible research practices fuel the development and adoption of open source software solutions tailored for scientific and scholarly purposes.

By understanding and embracing the interconnected nature of open science, open scholarship, open data, and open source software, researchers, educators, and Saint Louis University can create a more transparent, collaborative, and impactful ecosystem for knowledge creation, dissemination, and application.

## Research Funding Mandates for Open Scholarship and Open Science

In recent years governmental and private funding agencies have implemented various mandates and policies to promote open scholarship, open science, and data sharing practices.
