# Community Partners

## About

We welcome the participation of anyone interested in contributing to the projects in our portfolio. You can work on open issues on projects in our portfolio, create a new issue, or e-mail us if you want to be more involved.

Join the conversation in the Open Source with SLU [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/oswslu/shared_invite/zt-24f0qhjbo-NkSfQ4LOg5wXxBdxP4vzfA).

## Overview

* Join our Slack workspace.
* Contribute changes to an Open Source with SLU project.
* Add your name to the Contributors list.
* After making five contributions, you can be added to the `oss-slu` team in GitHub by contacting one of the program staff.

## Getting Started

The success of our projects depends on active involvement. Anyone interested in getting involved with Open Source with SLU projects can sign up by opening a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) on the [contributors](contributors.md) page in this website. The PR will be merged when the Pull Request includes a link to a merged ticket from a project in the [portfolio](../portfolio.md) that they made contribution to, and the PR has been approved by the current tech lead on that project.

If you want to be recognized as a contributor, your pull request should include your name and a link to the work you have completed on an Open Source with SLU project.

* [ ] Add your name to the list in `docs/about/contributors.md`;
  * Each entry must include a name;
  * Each entry may optionally include a link to a GitHub user profile;
  * Add your entry to the end of the list.
* [ ] Add a link to an already merged Pull Request or a closed Issue in an OSS [project](https://oss-slu.github.io/docs/portfolio) to your Pull Request. You can use the autolinked references formats for [issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests).

## Join the `oss-slu` Team

After making five contributions, you can be added to the `oss-slu` team in GitHub by contacting one of the program staff. Send an e-mail to <oss@slu.edu> or a slack message to the current Tech Lead on the project(s) you made contributions to. Include a list of at least five closed Issues and/or merged Pull Requests that you worked on.
 
## Git

All our projects are stored in public GitHub repositories. To make code contributions to our repositories, you will need to know the basics about Git and GitHub. We recommend this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk), if you are not familiar with these tools.

## Guidance

When you are ready to contribute code to one of our open-source project, here is the process you should follow:

1. Identify the issue you want to work on and post a comment in this issue, asking the repo maintainer to assign the issue to you.
2. Crate a fork of our repository. Here is GitHub documentation for how to [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
3. Clone your fork of the repository. Here is GitHub documentation for how to clone [a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
4. Follow the developer guide to install project dependencies and run the code.
5. Make the necessary code changes to resolve the issue. Commit and push your changes frequently. Use meaningful commit messages when committing your code.
6. Test your changes, verifying that the issue is resolved.
7. Create a pull request - a request to merge changes from your fork of the repository to the original repository. Here is GitHub documentation for how to [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Make sure to note the issue number that your pull request resolves, and include details of your solution.
8. One of our repository maintaners will review your pull request and will either merge it with the original repo, or request some changes. If changes are requested, go back to step 5 and proceed from there.
