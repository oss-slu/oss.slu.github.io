# Community Partners

## About

We welcome the participation of anyone interested in contributing to the projects in our portfolio. You can work on open issues on projects in our portfolio, create a new issue, or e-mail us if you want to be more involved.

## Git

All of our projects are stored in public GitHub repositories. To make code contributions to our repositories, you will need to know the basics about Git and GitHub. We recommend this <a href="https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk">video tutorial</a>, if you are not familiar with these tools.

## Guidance

When you are ready to contribute code to one of our open-source project, here is the process you should follow:

1. Identify the issue you want to work on and post a comment in this issue, asking the repo maintainer to assign the issue to you.
2. Create a fork of our repository. Here is GitHub documentation for how to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">create a fork</a>
3. Clone your fork of the repository. Here is GitHub documentation for how to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">clone a repository</a>.
4. Follow the developer guide to install project dependencies and run the code.
5. Make the necessary code changes to resolve the issue. Commit and push your changes frequently. Use meaningful commit messages when committing your code.
6. Test your changes, verifying that the issue is resolved.
7. Create a pull request - a request to merge changes from your fork of the repository to the original repository. Here is GitHub documentation for how to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork">create a pull request</a>. Make sure to note the issue number that your pull request resolves, and include details of your solution.
8. One of our repository maintainers will review your pull request and will either merge it with the original repo, or request some changes. If changes are requested, go back to step 5 and proceed from there.
