# Portfolio

Open Source with SLU makes open source software that supports research.

## New Projects

We are open to new project requests. Learn more on our [software request page](about/software).
We are especially interested in projects supporting researchers, focused on research outcomes, meeting unmet needs.

## Current Capstone Projects

<!-- **Project Name** One-sentence description of the purpose of the project  -->
**[Bubble Scan](project_bubblescan/about.md)** - The bubble scan is a web application where the user provides digital copies of standard paper scantron sheets in a PDF format and the software produces tabular results in a CSV file.

**[DADS (Database of Arithmetic Dynamical Systems)](project_dads/about.md)** - The goal of this project is to create a flexible, web-based, search-driven user interface for a database of arithmetic dynamical systems  
  
**[Data Entry & Exhibition for Rerum](project_deer/about.md)** - A designer's framework for non-destructive annotation and template rendering for distributed digital resources and collections.  
  
**[Drone World](project_droneworld/about.md)** - DroneWorld is a platform for testing small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) applications by simulating realistic test scenarios based on specified requirements.

**[Electronic Structure Parser](./project_esp/about.md)** - The esp is a web application that allows the user to upload the ORCA/Gaussian data and the software produces tabular results in a Word document.
  
**[Gallery of Glosses](./project_gallery_of_glosses/about.md)** - Interfaces to view and manage Glosses  
  
**[MeltShiny](project_meltshiny/about.md)** - automates the analysis and visualization of DNA melting curves for researchers in chemistry, biology, and genetics.  
  
**[Mouser](project_mouser/about.md)** - This software is used for tracking the data of animal experiments.  
  
**[Pi4Micronaut](project_pi4micronaut/about.md)** - A Java library crafted for developers who aim to build IoT  applications leveraging the Raspberry Pi platform.  
  
**[Rerum Geolocator](project_rerum_geolocator/about.md)** - The application enables users to enhance discovery and access to digital resources through geographic visualization and annotation.  
  
**[Seeing Is Believing](project_sib/about.md)** - An educational learning tool enabling visualizing the pronunciation of Spanish words.

**[Shelter Volunteers](project_shelter_volunteers/about.md)** - Simplify the process of scheduling work shifts for volunteers, and to give homeless shelters visibility into their upcoming staffing.  
  
**[Speech Tagging](project_saltify/about)** - This software transcribes an audio sample into a written format that is accepted by SALT software.   
  
**[Where's Religion Desktop](project_wheres_religion_desktop/about.md)** - Where's Religion Desktop is an enhancement on the mobile version which will have extended features.  
  
**[Where's Religion Mobile](project_wheres_religion_mobile/about.md)** - This Project is to create an application for ethnographers to capture the events happening around them along with some audio/visual representation of the event.  

**[Enhancing Bioinformatics Research through LLM](project_enhancing_bioinformatics_research_through_LLM/about.md)** - This project is focused on developing an AI-driven tool that supports bioinformatics research by providing intelligent API recommendations, detecting errors, and offering real-time corrections. The tool leverages large language models trained on bioinformatics codebases to ensure reliable data retrieval and analysis, ultimately improving research accuracy and efficiency.

## Current Internal Service Projects

**[Inner Peace Time](project_innerpeacetime/about.md)** - Inner peace time is a guided meditation app developed to help children and families breathe for calm and find their safe place for LOVE and HEALING.

**[iSpraak](project_ispraak/about.md)** - This project is to automate speech evaluation of language learners and to provide them with instantaneous corrective feedback.
