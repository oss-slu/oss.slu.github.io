Welcome to the TBE File Processing Suite—a groundbreaking toolkit designed to make handling metadata-enriched tabular data seamless across multiple programming languages. This open-source project is tailored for developers and analysts working with complex data, offering unmatched flexibility and efficiency.

### What is TBE?

At its core, TBE (Tabular Data with Metadata Blocks and Enrichment) files bring order to chaos by combining structured tabular data with rich metadata and optional attributes. The hallmark of a TBE file is its ability to clearly organize data using sections marked by control codes like BGN (begin) and EOT (end).

This ensures precise parsing, validation, and manipulation—making it indispensable for large-scale data projects.
It’s an open-source toolkit designed to support the development, management, and processing of TBE files—which are **tabular data files enriched with metadata**. Unlike regular .csv files that contain only raw data, **TBE files** include valuable context, such as information about data sources, units, timestamps, and calculated fields. This makes them far more useful and versatile for modern data workflows.

### Key TBE features include:

**TBL Sections**: Named data tables with headers and rows.

**Attributes (ATT)**: Key-value pairs that enrich data context.

**Comments (CMT)**: Embedded insights for better understanding.

**Control Codes**: Indicators that segment and structure data.

### The Vision Behind the Suite

Managing TBE files across varied use cases like inventory tracking, research, and analytics demanded a versatile toolset. The TBE File Processing Suite answers this need by offering dedicated libraries for Python, R, Java, Rust, JavaScript, and C. Each library adheres to a unified TBE standard while catering to the strengths of its respective language.

Looking ahead, we aim to expand this suite with additional libraries essential for data handling projects, including specialized workflows for air quality sensor data and other emerging needs in data-driven domains

### Why Choose TBE File Processing Suite?

Because data workflows today demand context, interoperability, and scalability. Standard .csv files fall short in these areas. The TBE suite fills that gap, making it easier to handle enriched workflows, collaborate across teams, and ensure data compatibility across tools and languages. It’s a solution designed for modern challenges in data science, analytics, and beyond.

Here’s how the suite empowers users:

**For Python Developers**: Easy parsing and metadata aggregation, led by Supraja and Harshitha.

**For R Analysts**: Advanced statistical tools, maintained by Pranitha Bollepalli.

**For Java Enterprise Applications**: Robust data processing capabilities, overseen by Manohar.

**For High-Performance Applications**: Rust and C libraries optimized for speed and resource efficiency.

**For Web and Scripting**: JavaScript CLI tools to validate TBE files effortlessly.

### How it works

1. You start with a **standard .csv file**, which contains only basic tabular data.

2. The TBE File Processing Suite steps in to convert that .csv into a **TBE-compliant .csv, adding rich metadata** and **enrichment** to the file.

3. The result? A more powerful, standardized dataset that can be used across programming languages and tools, ensuring greater **interoperability and data integrity**.

This enriched structure makes it easier to manage complex datasets, collaborate with different teams, and scale your workflows as needed.

### Sample Data for Real-World Context

To illustrate the power of this toolkit, the repository includes sample files such as:

**saq_bluesky_bgd_20211001_20230430_inv_tbe.csv** (Inventory data for Bluesky BGD from Oct 2021 to Apr 2023)

**saq_bluesky_dku_20210715_20230131_inv_tbe.csv** (Bluesky DKU data from Jul 2021 to Jan 2023)

**saq_bluesky_npl_20220830_20230404_inv_tbe** ( inventory data for Bluesky NPL from August 30, 2022, to April 4, 2023.)

These samples demonstrate TBE’s enriched structure and serve as test data for suite functionalities.

### How It All Started

This project began with a Python library that enabled basic TBE file processing. From that foundation, we evolved into the TBE File Processing Suite—a multi-language toolset that supports reading, validating, editing, and saving TBE files. This evolution was driven by the needs of projects like air quality sensor data workflows, where enriched data and interoperability are essential.
The TBE File Processing Suite is a collaborative initiative by Open Source with SLU. The project emerged from the need to simplify multi-language data handling for diverse use cases. By standardizing TBE file operations, we’ve bridged the gap between researchers, developers, and analysts.

### What Makes It Special?

**Multi-Language Support**: Unified data handling across six languages.

**Open Source**: Freely accessible for contributions and enhancements.

**Scalable Design**: Built for projects ranging from small-scale analytics to enterprise systems.
