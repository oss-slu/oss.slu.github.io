**What:** Code and Coffee : Meetup  
**When:** Wednesday, Oct 23, 12:00 a.m.–2:00 p.m.  
**Where:** TechArtista UCity 725 Kingsland Ave Suite 100

### A Welcoming and Diverse Community

The event provided a very welcoming atmosphere, with people from various backgrounds. It was incredible to meet people who have great experience in programming, each with their preferred languages, even COBOL. One person humorously shared that they hate COBOL but mentioned that we could still make a good living if we wish to get into it early though we'd probably hate every minute of it (laughs)
We met people working in different areas of tech, such as full-stack web development, machine learning, and Android development. What was great about them was the enthusiasm they had for their work. Each person spoke passionately about their current projects. It was inspiring to hear how deeply these individuals care about their work and how it motivates them.

### Sharing My Journey as a CS Graduate Student

As we went around introducing ourselves, we had the opportunity to share our background as a Computer Science graduate student involved in the open-source initiative at SLU. We talked about how we build and deliver open-source software to solve real-world problems. It felt great to represent a cause that’s so impactful and aligned with the values of the group

It was incredibly rewarding to discuss our ongoing projects and how they align with the group’s values of collaboration, creativity, and meaningful contribution. We even got to share details about some of the OSS (Open Source Software) projects we’re currently working on, receiving valuable feedback and advice in return.

### Did We Write Code There?

Not quite! While most of the event was conversational, we had engaging discussions about fun coding techniques and how to write code more efficiently using AI tools. These conversations sparked ideas about how modern tools can accelerate development and make problem-solving more dynamic. Sharing our thoughts on open-source projects led to exciting discussions about their potential applications and improvements.

### Creativity in Tech

One of the most interesting conversations was with a person who has seven years of industry experience but comes from an art background. He shared how tech is a medium for expressing creativity, much like art. It’s not about mastering a specific language or framework. It’s about solving problems that require creative thinking. He spoke about the satisfaction that comes when everything falls into place, like completing a piece of art.

### Invaluable Encouragement

Everyone at the event was incredibly encouraging. Many people we spoke with appreciated the value-driven development that we’re involved in, especially since we’re working on open-source projects. As we shared our experiences and showed them our work, we felt happy to receive such positive feedback. It was helpful to receive advice and feedback from people in tech.

### Plans to Return

Absolutely, we’re planning to attend future meetups! Events like Code and Coffee foster both personal and professional growth. Next time, we’d love to bring more members from our OSS team or even other tech leads from SLU. It would be a great opportunity to strengthen our team bond while engaging with the local tech community.

### A Great Event to Check Out

Overall, attending Code and Coffee was a refreshing and inspiring experience. If you're in the tech space and want to connect with others, whether you’re working on a personal project or just want to chat, We highly recommend checking it out. It’s a great way to meet people, learn new things, and find inspiration. The event takes place every other Sunday, and you can find more details on meetup.com.
